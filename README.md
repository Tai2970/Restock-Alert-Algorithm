README â€“ Restock Alert Algorithm
This project implements a lightweight restock alert system designed for supermarkets. The algorithm uses basic product information and simulated sales data to determine whether an item on the shelf needs to be restocked (ALERT) or reordered entirely (ORDER). It avoids the need for external sensors by calculating shelf quantity changes from point-of-sale behavior.

How to Run
To run this project, you must have Python 3 installed on your machine. The only required packages are pandas and tabulate.

First, install the required libraries using the command:
pip install pandas tabulate

Then, run the program using this command:
python main.py

The script will simulate product sales, update shelf quantities, and output:

Runtime and memory usage performance

A table of ALERT items that require restocking

A table of ORDER items that are fully out of stock and need to be reordered
